#summary Follow this guide to install and setup iPhone Today
#labels Phase-Deploy

=*The Walkthrough *=

= Introduction =
I will add more here soon

= Preparation =
*FIRST and MOST IMPORTANT: Back up your phone*

  # Start by downloading one of the iPhone_Today.cab files from the downloads section
    * This will install all of the needed files for iPhone Today to work.
    * If this is an update and you have already installed iPT; backup your icons.xml and settings.xml files. Install the new version and then put your icons and settings files back in. 

=How To Install=
  # Copy the iPhone Today cab onto your phone.
  # On your phone, and navigate to where you placed the cab.
  # Click the iPhgoneToday.cab file and install it to your phone. *DO NOT INSTALL TO THE STORAGE CARD* 
  # You will have 2 versions installed; 
    * the exe version is opened like any program (start menu --> programs --> iPhoneToday.exe) This is full screen mode. It will exit if you press home or end. This works very well with programs that use tabs, like TF3d.
    * Or you can use iPhoneToday as a today plug-in. Go into "Start --> Settings --> Today --> Today items" and disable all other today plugins except iPhone Today
  # Use the icon and settings UI managers to add/edit icons (See below for UI instructions)
  # For advanced functions and the “missing bars” see the next setp

==Setup after install==

==When you select *“Add Icon”* or *“Edit Icon”* you will enter the icon edit menu==

===Icon Menu===

  Screen: This should be filled out all ready; to add the icon to a different screen or a new screen, change this number. To set the icon to the bottom static bar (the bottom icons do not move) set screen to -1. Note that the 1st page is number 0, the second page is number 1 and so on. 

  * Icon: Location of the icon on that page. Note that the 1st icon is number 0; the second icon is number 1 and so on. 
  * Name: This is the name that will display under the icon
  * Image: this is the location of the picture for the icon
  * Type: If this is a special icon, select it, otherwise select normal
  * Execute: This is the program that runs when the icon is pressed. 
    * WARNING Do not select any exe, lnk, mscr files with any of these characters !@#$%^&()+=-<>,./ This will crash iPhoneToday. If you need to use a file with one of these create a shortcut to that file and aim the icon at that shortcut. See below for creating shortcuts and MortScript files.
  * Parameters: this is a command or setting used for the program being run. For example if you have a program that dials a number, this is where you would put the phone number (Warning If you add quotations (“) to parameters it will crash the plug-in)
  * ExecuteAlt: What runs when the icon (special icon) has a status
  * ParamsAlt: this is a command or setting used for the Alt program being run if any. 
  * Launch Animation: Check this if you want a simple animation when the icon is pressed
